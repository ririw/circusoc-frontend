            The UNSW Circus Society has a tradition of diversity, creativity and sharing within an
            environment that supports physical theatre and skill development. Just as it takes several
            people to build a human pyramid, it takes as many people to create a performance. On stage,
            backstage, or in administration, these many hands work together to bring fun, fervour, and fire
            to life.
        </p>

        <p>
            We nurture and support aspiring performers - from acrobats and contortionists, to clowns,
            fire-breathers, jugglers, magicians and stilt-walkers - providing members opportunities to work
            with established industry performers and circus groups.
        </p>

        <p>
            From full-length shows and corporate functions to private parties, we offer competitive pricing
            and a professional attitude.
